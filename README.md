# Loops java
---

### Part 1: While loops
- Implement a while loop that prints out the multiplication table of the given input number.

---

### Part 2: Do While loops

- Create a new Java class with a main method(so you can run your code) called Fibonacci
- The Fibonacci numbers are a traditional computer science problem: "each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1."
- The beginning of the sequence is thus: `0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 ...`
- Add the following import to be able to capture user input n.
- Implement a Do While loop that calculates Fibonacci(n).

### Part 3: For loops

- Use the for loop to create a programm that ask the user to input a name and then prints each of the letters of the name

Hint You can use the following String functions:

`lenght()` -> returns the total number of characters of a given String
`chartAt(i)` -> returns the character at the given position(i) of a String
